Kubernetes Cluster Health Checker and Auto-Healing



Project Goals
1. Develop an automated health monitoring system for Kubernetes clusters, focusing on key metrics like node health, pod statuses, and resource utilization.
2. Implement self-healing actions that restart failed pods, reschedule workloads, and, if necessary, trigger scaling events to balance workloads.
3. Provide real-time alerts and notifications to inform the team of critical issues that may require manual intervention.
4. Create a web dashboard to display real-time health status, historical data, and auto-healing logs for transparency and traceability.


Tools Used
- Programming Languages: Go (for performance and Kubernetes API compatibility), Python (for scripting and initial data processing)
- Kubernetes API: For interacting with and managing Kubernetes resources
- Prometheus: For monitoring and collecting metrics from the Kubernetes cluster
- Grafana: For visualizing metrics and health status on a real-time dashboard
- Alertmanager (Prometheus): For sending alerts to Slack or other communication tools
- Slack API: For notifications to DevOps teams
- Docker: To containerize the application and deploy it as a microservice



 Sprint 1: Project Setup and Kubernetes Cluster Access
  - Define project structure and initialize the repository.
  - Set up access to the Kubernetes cluster.
  - Configure basic API access to interact with Kubernetes resources (nodes, pods, services).
  - Install and configure Prometheus for Kubernetes to monitor cluster metrics.
  - Goal: Establish a foundation for the project by setting up the necessary environment, tools, and access to Kubernetes resources.

Install Prometheus + Grafana
o	helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus community.github.io/helm-charts
o	helm repo update
o	helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring
Verify:
o	kubectl get pods -n monitoring


Sprint 2: Health Monitoring Module (Node & Pod Checks)
  - Develop a module to monitor the health of nodes and pods using the Kubernetes API.
  - Set up Prometheus metrics collection for node and pod statuses (e.g., CPU, memory usage, pod readiness).
  - Begin integrating Prometheus with Grafana to visualize key metrics.
  - Implement initial threshold-based alerts for critical health issues using Alertmanager.
  - Goal: Enable basic health checks on nodes and pods and set up alerts for critical issues.


Sprint 2 Deliverables
‚Ä¢	Go module that monitors node & pod health and exposes metrics (/metrics)
‚Ä¢	Prometheus scraping your service (via ServiceMonitor)
‚Ä¢	Grafana dashboard panels showing node/pod health
‚Ä¢	Alertmanager rules for ‚Äúcritical‚Äù states (e.g., node not ready, pod failures)

Extend Go app with metrics
o	go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.17.0
o	Update cmd/selfhealer/main.go

‚Ä¢ Checks node readiness
‚Ä¢ Checks pod readiness
‚Ä¢ Exposes Prometheus metrics at :9090/metrics

Expose service to Prometheus
	Create a Service for the app ‚Äì
deploy/service.yaml
deploy/service-monitor.yaml
	Grafana dashboards
‚Ä¢	Import a new dashboard (create or use templates).
‚Ä¢	Panels to add:
‚Ä¢	Node Health Gauge: query avg(k8s_node_health_status)
‚Ä¢	Pod Readiness: count by (namespace) (k8s_pod_ready_status==0)
‚Ä¢	Failed Pods Over Time: use PromQL with rate(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[5m])

Sprint 3: Self-Healing Mechanisms (Pod Recovery)
  - Implement pod restart and rescheduling based on health checks (e.g., if a pod is unresponsive or has failed).
  - Add automated resource cleanup for pods in "CrashLoopBackOff" or "Evicted" states.
  - Test self-healing actions in a staging environment.
  - Log each action for auditing and reporting.
  - Goal: Automate pod recovery processes and ensure that self-healing actions are logged for transparency.

Step 1: Create a ‚Äúhealer‚Äù module
Create a new Go file for self-healing logic.
o	New-Item -ItemType File -Path ".\pkg\healer\pod_recovery.go"
Step 2: Update the main file
o	cmd/selfhealer/main.go
Step 3: Build and Dockerize
o	Dockerfile/docker

ÔÉò	docker build -t yourdockerhubusername/k8s-selfhealer:v3 -f .\docker\Dockerfile .
ÔÉò	docker push yourdockerhubusername/k8s-selfhealer:v3


Sprint 4: Advanced Self-Healing (Node Scaling & Resource Balancing)
  - Implement automatic node scaling (up/down) based on resource utilization.
  - Configure horizontal pod autoscaling for workloads with high resource demands.
  - Set up resource balancing by redistributing pods across nodes to optimize cluster usage.
  - Test these features under simulated load to ensure reliability.
  - Goal: Ensure the system can scale and balance resources automatically, optimizing cluster performance and cost.


	Add Prometheus metrics to your self-healer service

	Instrument your code
o	internal/monitor/metrics.go
o	go run main.go


Deploy Prometheus

ÔÇß	kubectl create namespace monitoring
ÔÇß	kubectl apply -f .\deploy\prometheus\prometheus-deploy.yaml
